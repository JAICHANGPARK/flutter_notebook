__Suffragettes__ were women in the early 20th century who believed they should have the right to vote (suffrage). This movement happened in the United Kingdom and United States.

For many years women were not allowed to vote, and so they fought for their rights. In their protests, they ended up getting arrested. In the UK, women over 30 got the right to vote in 1918. This was lowered to 21 in 1928. Similar struggles went on in all the English-speaking countries.
