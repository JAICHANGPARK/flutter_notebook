__Charles Darwin__ (1809â€“1882) wrote his On the Origin of Species in 1859. In this book, he put forward much evidence that evolution had occurred. He also proposed natural selection as the way evolution had taken place. But Darwin did not understand about genetics and how traits were actually passed on. He could not accurately explain what made children look like their parents.

Nevertheless, __Darwin's__ explanation of evolution was fundamentally correct. In contrast to Lamarck, __Darwin's__ idea was that the giraffe's neck became longer because those with longer necks survived better. These survivors passed their genes on, and in time the whole race got longer necks.
