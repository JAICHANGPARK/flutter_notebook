East African sites, such as Chesowanja near Lake Baringo, Koobi Fora, and Olorgesailie in Kenya, show potential evidence that __fire__ was utilized by early humans. At Chesowanja, archaeologists found fire-hardened clay fragments, dated to 1.42 M.Y.A. Analysis showed that, in order to harden it, the clay must have been heated to about 400 °C (752 °F). At Koobi Fora, two sites show evidence of control of __fire__ by Homo erectus at about 1.5 M.Y.A., with reddening of sediment associated with heating the material to 200-400 degrees Celsius (392-752 degrees Fahrenheit).
