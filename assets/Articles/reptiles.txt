__Reptile__ is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates. It is not used so much by biologists, who use more accurate terms.

The name __"reptile"__ comes from Latin and means "one who creeps". All living __reptile__ species are cold blooded, have scaly skin, and lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid (instead of urea), and have a cloaca. A cloaca is a shared opening for the anus, urinary tract and reproductive ducts. __Reptiles__ also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals.

Many important groups of __reptiles__ are now extinct, for example the mosasaurs. We used to say the dinosaurs were extinct, but they survive in the form of their feathered descendants (birds). Ancient __reptiles__ that do survive include the turtles, the crocodiles and the Tuatara, the lone survivor of its group. The great majority of present-day __reptiles__ are snakes and lizards.

The study of living __reptiles__ is called herpetology.
