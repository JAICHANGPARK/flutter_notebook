__Insects__, are a class in the phylum Arthropoda. They are small terrestrial invertebrates which have a hard exoskeleton.

__Insects__ are the largest group of animals on earth by far: about 926,400 different species have been described. They are more than half of all known living species. They may be over 90% of animal species on Earth.

New species of __insects__ are continually being found. Estimates of the total number of species range from 2 million to 30 million.

__Insects__ have six legs; and most have wings. __Insects__ were the first animals capable of flight. As they develop from eggs, __insects__ undergo metamorphosis. __Insects__ live all over the planet: almost all are terrestrial (live on land). Few __insects__ live in the oceans or in very cold places, such as Antarctica. The most species live in tropical areas.

Some people call all __insects__ "bugs", but this is not correct. Only some __insects__ are true bugs, which is a particular order of __insects__. People who study __insects__ are called entomologists.
