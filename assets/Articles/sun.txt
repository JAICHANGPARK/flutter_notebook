The __Sun__ in the center of our solar system is a yellow dwarf star. It gives off energy as light. That includes light, infra-red energy (heat), ultraviolet light and radio waves. It also gives off a stream of particles, which reaches Earth as "solar wind". The source of all this energy is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy.

The __Sun__ is a star like many others in our Milky Way galaxy. It has existed for a little over 4.5 billion years, and is going to continue for at least as long. The __Sun__ is about a hundred times as wide as the Earth. It has a mass of 1.9891Ã—1030 kg, which is 333,000 times the mass of the Earth. The Earth can also fit inside the __Sun__ 1.3 million times.

Scientists think that the __Sun__ started from a very large cloud of dust and small bits of ice about 4.567 billion years ago.

At the center of that huge cloud, gravity caused the material to build up into a ball. Once this got big enough, the huge pressure inside started a fusion reaction. The energy this released caused that ball to heat and shine.

The energy radiated from the __Sun__ pushed away the rest of the cloud from itself, and the planets formed from the rest of this cloud.
