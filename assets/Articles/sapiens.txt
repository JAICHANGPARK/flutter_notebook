Modern humans are defined as the __Homo sapiens__ species, of which the only living subspecies is known as __Homo sapiens sapiens__.

Modern humans are sometimes called "anatomically modern humans". Homo sapiens considers itself the most influential species on the planet. However, many kinds of life, especially plants and protists, have had a much greater effect on the air, the rocks, life, and natural environment on Earth.
