Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class Mammalia. They have fur or hair and a very precise kind of temperature regulation.

With the exception of the monotremes, all mammals bear live young. They also produce milk for the young. Parental care of the young is universal among mammals, and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring.
