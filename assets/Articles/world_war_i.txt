Most of the fighting was in Europe, but soldiers from many other countries took part, and it changed the colonial empires of the European powers. Before World War II began in 1939, __World War I__ was called the Great War, the World War or the 'war to end all wars'. 135 countries took part in __World War I__, and nearly 10 million people died while fighting.

__World War I__ was fought by most of the countries of Europe. The actual fighting was on many different fronts. The Western Front was where most of the fighting between Germany and the Allies happened. Most of the fighting here was trench warfare.

The Eastern Front was fought in Central and Eastern Europe. Fighting here was not trench warfare but mobile warfare due to the size of the front. Much fighting happened in the Middle Eastern Front and the Italian Front. Fighting also took place in Africa, China, and at sea as well as in the air.

The war was ended by the signing of many different treaties, the most important being the Treaty of Versailles.
